# iTimeTable - Lightweight Time Table Generator 

Using paper work to print the timetable is tiresome and very much expensive since a lot of
paper is used to print the whole university timetable containing all the courses from
certificate to PhD. Some units and classes may collide hence causing confusion in the
learning institution but coming with a timetable system that is web based will be much
cheaper compared to the printed timetable and itâ€™s also easier to not the colliding units of the
same lecturer and units that are to be taught at the same room same time. The other thing it
will solve the issue of student crowding at the noticeboards since they will be accessing
online.
